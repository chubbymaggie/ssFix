# Experiments

The repair information for each bug for which ssFix produced a plausible patch
can be found in `./rslt`. At each line, from left to right, it shows the bug id,
the running time (in minutes) for find the patch, whether it is plausible (all
TRUE in the file), whether it is valid/correct (TRUE_STAR or TRUE_STAR_HW for a
valid patch, and TRUE for a correct patch), the rank of the candidate used for
producing the patch, whether the candidate is local or non-local, and the number
of patches that ssFix tested before finding the patch.

All the generated patches by all the tools (ssFix, jGenProg, jKali, NoPol, HDRepair,
and ACS) can be found under `./patch`.

All the candidates that ssFix used for producing all the plausible patches can be
found under `./candidate`.
